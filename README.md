- Download the template project. Built using .NET framework 4.8
- Change platform from "Any CPU" to "x64"
- Follow comments to solve the exercises
- First build might take more, the required NuGet packages must be downloaded

## Grading and submission
- Exercises 1-12 are worth 0.6p each
- Exercise 13 is worth 2.8p
- Upload to Moodle your code (you can copy-paste 'LabOpenCV.cs') and the resulting images for each exercise
