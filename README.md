# UPB-PIMS-L4-Template-OpenCV-CSharp
OpenCV using a C# wrapper laboratory for image processing

- Download the template project. Built using .NET framework 4.8
- Change platform from "Any CPU" to "x64"
- **Force rebuild when opening the project for the first time. Otherwise, a .dll exception might occur. If this still happens, delete the Debug and/or Release folders and force rebuild again**
- First build might take more, the required NuGet packages must be downloaded
- Follow comments to solve the exercises

## Grading and submission
- Exercises 1-12 are worth 0.6p each
- Exercise 13 is worth 2.8p
- Upload to Moodle your code (you can copy-paste 'LabOpenCV.cs') and the resulting images for each exercise

Note: The requirement for this lab is to use OpenCV. You can solve the exercises in any language (it's up to you to configure OpenCV)
